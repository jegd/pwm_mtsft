There is a large setup violation of -59.083 ns between sist_i/pwm_3ip_0/U0/pwm_3ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg1_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and sist_i/pwm_3ip_0/U0/pwm_3ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/pwm_inst/n_ciclos_on2__1/A[1] (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
